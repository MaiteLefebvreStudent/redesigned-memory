    "# Cannabis legalization sentiment analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Twitter is one of the most important real-time communication networks functioning nowadays. Its popularity allows that hundreds of millions of tweets come into existence each day. People with access to this platform across the world can share their point of view or discuss with other users about any topic, from politics to entertainment, regardless of its geographical location or the closeness of their personal relationship. \n",
    "This detail and the rapid development of methodologies for dealing with the quantity and velocity of the data flowing in the stream, turns Twitter into an useful tool for approaching a sector of the public opinion. \n",
    "\n",
    "For this assignment, our aim is to retrieve some tweets, process and analyze them using the sentiment analysis technique in Python. This approach will allow us to understand the attitudes and perspectives of the users' manifest opinions. The topic of interest is cannabis and the legalization of its recreational use. We will try to find out how many times words related to cannabis and its legalization are used and in which direction of emotion –positive or negative– it goes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, the production, commerce and possession of psychoactive substances from three plants —namely coca leaf, opium poppy, and cannabis— are criminalized in the majority of the countries around the globe (Feilding, 2014). This prohibitionist approach has demonstrated been inefficient in terms of reducing its use. According to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, the global cocaine production in 2016 reached out its highest level ever reviewed with an approximation of 1,410 tons being manufactured. Opium production followed the same upward trend. From 2016 to 2017 the production increased up to 65 percent since the start of the XXI century, standing at 10,500 tons. Finally, cannabis showed no exception, it was the most extensively used drug in 2016: 192 million people consumed at least once in that year and it seems that the increase of it will not diminish in the future (UNODC, 2018).\n",
    "\n",
    "### The cannabis plant\n",
    "\n",
    "The cannabis plant has been used for a variety of purposes over the past 3,000 years. Its range of applications goes from making textiles and cordage up to religious and recreational applications. This plant contains a variety of chemical compounds, being the following two the best known: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Cannabidiol (CBD), recognized for its medical applications and whose sale is legal for personal consumption in some countries, like Belgium itself; and, \n",
    "- Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), best known for being the prohibited substance that can lift oneself into an altered state of consciousness. \n",
    "\n",
    "Historically, its utilization spread from Asia to Africa stretching out to Europe and the USA sole in the modern era (Feilding, 2014). Regardless of its relatively recent use in the western countries, it is the preferred psychoactive in terms of number of users. For this reason, its implications on criminal justice, economic issues and public health consecuenses are of prime importance. \n"

    "### Public opinion and cannabis use \n",
    "\n",
    "Public opinion regarding the recreational use of the cannabis plant tend to be more positive in countries like Uruguay, Canada and the Netherlands, where its recreational consume has been decriminalized (Mcginty _et al_., 2017). The perception there tends to be positive as the main idea is that cannabis is somewhat safer when compared with the effects of other drugs (Cohen _et al_., 2019). Generally, the debate is mostly centered for the pro-legalization in the economic and other policy advantages and, for those against it, in the public health risks (Mcginty _et al_., 2017).\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to measure public opinion is through the use of _large-scale web-based data_ (Lamy _et al_., 2016). The harvesting of websites and applications that allows people to generate and share content is becoming more popular for the massive quantity of information available (Kok & Sanen 2017). Twitter is specially useful. The analysis of data retrieved from this micro-blogging site is getting more attention given the volume of information, constantly updated. There's an average of 500 million new tweets per day (Cooper, 2019) making it relatively easy and fast to spot trends regarding almost any topic.\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis of tweeters perceptions regarding psychoactives is no exception. For instance, one can find the works of  Hanson _et al_., 2013 exploring the use of Aderall and West _et al_., 2012, investigating the relation between users and alcohol. On cannabis, some examples include Daniulaityte _et al_., 2015 searching data on cannabis concentrate use in the U.S. and, Lamy _et al_., 2016, working on edibles-related tweets. Although the search for literature wasn't exhaustive, this indicate the potential for scrutinizing tweets on linked topics.  \n",

An API  is a \"set of protocols and routines for building and interacting with software applications\"(Bowne-Anderson, n. d.). \n",

    "After creating the app, we need to retrieve the authentication credentials so we can access the API from Python. We use the _GET statuses/sample_ API, which returns \"a small random sample of all public statuses\" (Twitter, n.d.).\n",

In a nutshell, it consist in computing \"the proportion of the words [that] have positive connotations, negative connotations or are neutral. This method is commonly referred to as sentiment analysis. The typical approach to sentiment analysis is to see how many words in a text are also in a predefined list of words associated with a sentiment\" (Caren, 2019a). \n",

    "# Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to mention the limitations of our project. The first thing to take into consideration is that Twitter is not a comprehensive registry of all the topics of public discussion and its users do not represent the whole population. On the practical side, it was not possible to collect all the activity on the network nor from the users that behave passively –just browsing and watching. \n",
    "Since we used the standard APIs, it was not possible to collect information from the past and, additionally, we have access to only 1% of the data without knowing how the sample was selected. \n",
    "Furthermore, we did not tried to geolocate or give a special treatment to the retweets or emojis and, as mentioned before, we did not selected the complete universe of words that could refer to cannabis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sentiment analyisis has lots of potential and using Python can make it relatively easy as you can automate the process -once you get how to do it-. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Notes\n",
    "<sup>1</sup> We made many attemps at different days, each time giving the .txt a new number. The 420 was random (not!). Please, find attached a folder with all the .txt collected, some with a few tweets, others with some more. We wanted to create a super .txt file with all the tweets blended together and then run the sentiment analysis but our python knowledge wasn't enough to achieve a proper super file, everything got mixed.
